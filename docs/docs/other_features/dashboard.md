# Dashboard

Philter includes a user interface dashboard that can be accessed at `https://<Philter>:9000`.

> The Philter UI dashboard is intended only for configuration testing. Use Philter's [API](../api_and_sdks/api.md) for document redaction.

The dashboard provides the ability to test Philter's configuration and manage policies. Text and PDF documents can be submitted through the dashboard to analyze the redacted text and modify your filter policies.
